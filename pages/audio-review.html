        <h1>GSN Audio Reviewer</h1>

        <p>It is a full-stack application that allows users to log in to an account created for them by the Executive Producer of the project they worked on.  The Producer can upload audio files for review, and all other users can review them. <br />
            
        The audio files are stored in an S3 storage container and the reviews are stored in a PostgreSQL database. The front-end is built with React and the back-end is built with Node and Express. The app is deployed on Heroku for now.</p>

        <p>Link coming soon - Currently the app is in development and not ready for testing</p>
